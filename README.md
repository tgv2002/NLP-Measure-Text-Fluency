## Description 

This repository consists of the entire implementation of baselines, experiments and application which were implemented as part of a project of 'Introduction to NLP' course. It is regarding <b>measuring text fluency</b> and explores various features, language model architectures and classifiers, for the multi-label classification of text into labels such as - Fluent / Not Fluent / Neutral.

## Model checkpoints

* All the model checkpoints which were saved are uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16c04yf95_Ael0iXFmQuQKdhQm97SWWHE?usp=sharing). 
    * The 'app' folder consists of the language model (BERT), the classifier (Random Forest), tokenizer and vocabulary which are required by the application to perform real time predictions.
    * The 'models' folder consists of the RNN and LSTM language models, which were explored as a part of the experimentation.
